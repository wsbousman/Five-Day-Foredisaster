A simple forecasting utility making use of a third-party API call to retrieve data about a user-specified city, and pass that data
via DOM manipulation into Bootstrap-styled elements. Looking forward, I need to store previous search data in local storage and 
create buttons that will rerun the application when clicked. The temperature displayed is in Kelvin.
